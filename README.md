## Description

This project is an application that allows users to find upcoming concerts in a city of their choosing. The results for that city will be displayed on cards and feature the name of the event as well as the date, time and venue. The user has the option to save the event for later viewing, or view additional details about the event.

When the user clicks on the "See Event Details" link on the event card, information will be displayed under the event details section of the page and will feature a seating chart and additional details of the event, including a link that will take them to the site for purchasing tickets.

## Usage

Upon page load, the user will see a header, an entry field with a placeholder city, a search button, a blank box on the right and an empty 5-Day forecast section. The user will enter a city into the search field and either click the button or hit enter to start the search. The page will then display the current weather data and the five day forecast for the selected city. A button will also appear in the history section below the search bar that the user can click on at any time later to refresh the weather data for that city. If the user submits without entering a city or a city that does not exist, an alert will appear indicating such.
