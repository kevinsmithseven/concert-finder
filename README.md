# GigGuide

## Description

This project is an application that allows users to find upcoming concerts in a city of their choosing. The results for that city will be displayed on cards and feature the name of the event as well as the date, time and venue. The user has the option to save the event for later viewing, or view additional details about the event.

When the user clicks on the "See Event Details" link on the event card, information will be displayed under the event details section of the page and will feature a seating chart and additional details of the event, including a link that will take them to the site for purchasing tickets.

The application is also mobile responsive.

## Usage

Upon page load, the user will see the landing page with a header, a "My Saved Events" button, a hero image with the GigGuide text logo and tagline. They will also be invited to search for an event by clicking on the Search City button. When that ios clicked, a modal will pop up and present them with an input field where they can enter a city and click submit. Once submitted, a series or cards will appear in the left aside with details about upcoming events in the searched for city, sorted from sooner to later. The user can click on the card save button to save that event in local storage for later viewing. They can click the "See Event Details" button to display more information in the main section of the screen under the Event Details heading. This will include a seating map, price ranges of tickets (if available) and additional information of note that the host has provided (if available)
